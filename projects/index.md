  description: T-REX is a canonical, invertible string representation for transition-metal complexes that explicitly encodes metal identity, coordination topology, geometry, oxidation state, and spin. Its extension, MUL-T-REX, generalizes to multinuclear clusters by capturing metal-metal connectivity and bridging topology at each site. These representations make inorganic chemical space searchable, reproducible, and model-ready.

  description: CAT-FM is a catalysis-focused foundation model that treats catalytic cycles as grammatical sequences of T-REX tokens, learning the causal logic of chemical transformations. Trained on dual data streams from high-fidelity manual datasets and automated literature extraction, CAT-FM supports downstream tasks including yield and selectivity prediction, mechanistic reasoning, and catalyst candidate generation.

  description: Building on the T-REX representation, we train property prediction and virtual screening models for transition-metal complexes across diverse application domains. Our curated datasets — tmCAT, tmPHOTO, tmBIO, and tmSCO — built using natural language processing of the primary literature, provide the training data that powers these models.

- title: Synthesizability Scoring for Inorganic Complexes
  subtitle: Assembly scores conditioned on metal identity and oxidation state
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: We are developing synthesizability models for inorganic complexes built on T-REX, predicting synthetic accessibility as a function of metal identity, oxidation state, and ligand architecture. These assembly-score-type models help prioritize computationally designed candidates that are likely to be experimentally realizable.

- title: Mechanophore Discovery via Transfer Learning
  subtitle: From deformation physics to reactivity prediction to scaffold discovery
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: We use a multi-stage transfer learning pipeline for mechanophore discovery. First, models learn per-bond and per-atom deformation physics from inexpensive DFT calculations. These are then transferred to predict mechanophore kinetics and reactivity under mechanical force. Finally, the trained models are deployed for high-throughput discovery of new mechanophore scaffolds with targeted properties.
